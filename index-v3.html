        Example I shows a footer with some copyright text in it as a fixed element. As you scroll, notice that it doesn’t move. Notice that the left and right offset properties are set to zero. Since the fixed value behaves similar to the absolute value, we can stretch the width of the element to fit the viewport while fixing the element to the bottom using bottom: 0;. Use caution with the fixed value: Support in older browsers is spotty at best. For example, older versions of Internet Explorer render fixed elements as static elements. And, you now know that static elements don’t behave like fixed elements, right?
